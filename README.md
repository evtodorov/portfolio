# Portfolio
## Introduction
This repo contains 'sanitized' descriptions of various projects which for one reason or another cannot be made public. No code is provided, and the projects' outlines have been carefully worded to avoid disclosing non-public information which may have commercial impacts. Still, I have compiled this portfolio not only to illustrate my experience, but to showcase the detail to some of the typical problems faced in industrial enviroments where the much buzz-worded "digital transformation" has lent a helping hand. 

The list below only captures projects where I am or at one point was the driving contributor. Some of them realize my own ideas, others have been sculpted by the guidance of more experienced colleagues.  Please note that while the tools are protected as proprietary know-how by the owner and may still be used or supported internally, they are generally not available as commercial products.

## Summary

1. **Speckler** - a tool for generating repeatable and customized textures to be applied in [Digital Image Correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_correlation_and_tracking) measurements which are used to provide rich data from physical tests 
2. **Optical measurement simulation plugin for Blender** - Optical measurements (e.g. [Digital Image Correlation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_image_correlation_and_tracking), [Photogrammetry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photogrammetry), [Photoelasticity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photoelasticity), High-speed videography, etc.) in physical tests need to comply with multiple practical constraints, while respecting tight project deadlines. This plugin to an open-source 3D modelling and render software enabled integrating the testing equipment with the digital mock-up of the test and test item in advance of production.
3. **NI DAQ Card mini-scope in Python** - Basic oscilloscope functionality built around a National Instruments data acquisiton card
4. **Automated Bolted Joint tool** - A tool integrating the data interfaces of digital mock-up, modelling post-processing software and detailed stress analysis methods
5. **Simplified Product tree explorer** - A GUI to enable displaying and exploring product structure data in a specific way which was not easily available through standard commercial packages
6. **Post-processing suite to existing combination and correlation software** - A wrapper package providing interface to an existing tool verified to certification requirements. Using the wrapper it is possible to satisfy contemporary requirements and scale the usage up without incurring cost for re-certification of the core functionality.
